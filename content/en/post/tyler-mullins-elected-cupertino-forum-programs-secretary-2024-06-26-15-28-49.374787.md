## Tyler Mullins Elected Cupertino Forum Programs Secretary

On June 21st, 2024, Mullins was elected unopposed to become the first Programs Secretary of the Cupertino Forum.

Since the Forum's founding, Mullins created new discord bots for the Nutmeg Blog and Twin Towns programs (read about them [Here](https://www.cupertino.forum/post/nutmeg-has-evolved--2024-06-04-19-08-15.269859/) and [Here](https://www.cupertino.forum/post/twin-towns-has-been-revived-and-improved--2024-06-13-19-32-57.442058/)). 

*"Nutmeg has been enhanced to bridge the gap between discord and the blog, in order to help members easily publish professional-looking news articles about their nation's development. Twin Towns has been enhanced as well, intending to serve as a catalyst for members to take their diplomatic relationships to the next level. New Athens and Levinia have already twinned their capitals and are planning cultural exchanges as a result. It's a strong start and I look forward to what we will achieve under this new system."*  - Tyler Mullins

Mullins looks forward to maintaining and developing simple but useful programs for the Cupertino Forum and the benefit of the community as a whole.
