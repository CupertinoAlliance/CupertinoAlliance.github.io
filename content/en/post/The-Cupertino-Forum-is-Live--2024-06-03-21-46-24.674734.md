## Welcome to the Cupertino Forum!
*A diplomatic forum for micronational cooperation, diplomacy, and socializing.*
[Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Up5o60SfCa-snuXolb1Evu0NzBOnzfuRvgzZAtRIrSY/edit?usp=sharing) is the document that describes how the forum works in detail.

The Cupertino Forum is the successor organization to the Cupertino alliance. While it still bares some resemblance, it is very different in form and function.
In the final days of the Cupertino Alliance, members claimed that the primary value that the CA provided for its members in its current state was as a social venue where members can discuss micronationalism, share news, see what others are doing, collaborate, and otherwise make friends. A few added that possibly the greatest moments within the alliance were during times when the administration leaned into these social aspects, such as the time of the first culture fests, Noted! Project, and Twin Towns project. 
From these thoughts, the idea was born of taking the CA and stripping out all the bureaucracy and unnecessary projects that no one actually used, and converting the organization into one that is significantly simpler in procedure and focuses solely on these social aspects as a way of encouraging development through diplomacy and idea-sharing, rather than by tasking an administration with running ministries and programs to do so. 
To this end, the Cupertino Forum was devised through the careful consideration of former Cupertino Alliance delegates: Tyler Mullins and Sertor Valentinus of New Athens, James Murray of Avalonia, Anthony G of Saspearian, and Phillip Joseph Pillin of Pibocip.
