{{< details title="Empire of Levinia (Click to Expand)" >}}

__***The Empire of Levina***__

**Executive**  
*The Emperor*  
Levinia is an absolute monarchy, meaning the Emperor has full control over the country. While we do have the constitution, the Emperor does not need to abide by it, which is said in the constitution. As Head of State and Head of Government, everything is done with the approval of the Emperor. Citizenship is granted and revoked at the discretion of the Emperor. The Emperor signs all diplomatic agreements and normally serves as Minister of Foreign affairs. The Emperor oversees the treasury and all government purchases and events. 

**Imperial Cabinet**  
*Prime Minister*  
The Prime Minister is picked by the Emperor, or the people can elect it if it is approved by the Emperor and they so wish. The Prime Minister runs the day-to-day government under supervision from the Emperor. The Emperor allows the PM to control the government, appoint ministers, etc.

*Cabinet of Ministers*  
Ministry of Economic Affairs and Finance  
Ministry of Foreign Affairs  
Ministry of Internal Affairs  
Ministry of Justice  
Ministry of Defense  
Ministry of Health and Social Welfare  
Ministry of Energy  
Ministry of Culture  
Ministry of Development  
Ministry of the Environment, Agriculture and Natural Resources  
Ministry of Post and Communication  
Ministry of Science, Innovation, and Technology  
Ministry of Education  

**Imperial Parliament**  
*The Imperial Senate*  
The Imperial Senate (TIS) is a house comprised of only appointed officials, that does not base its members on political parties. The Emperor may appoint anyone he likes to the Senate. It is the upper house in Levinia and debates on everything passed by the House of Representatives, the lower house. Normally they meet together, and collaborate on projects.

*The House of Representatives*  
The House of Representatives is the lower, elected house. Unlike the UK and American governments, the elections are held by political parties. Meaning instead of voting for a person, they vote for parties, which then translates to seats held in the House of Reps. So far the monarchist party has the highest approval rating and controls the House of Representatives. Party leaders select those who seem fit to serve. 

**Constitution**  
Levinia has a constitution that outlines how the country should be ran and how it functions. It includes instructions on Parliament, the Cabinet, etc. The constitution, unlike most, does not include human rights as that is passed by bills. The Levinian Constitution is just an instruction on government and less about rights. 

**Symbols**  
Our **national mythical creature** is a two-headed half-eagle half-dove bird. The heads looking west and east represent Levinia's desire to expand around the globe. The eagle side represents Levinian fierceness and the dove represents our peacemaking abilities. 
Our **national bird** is the Bluebird, which lives around Levinia and in the Imperial Palace itself.

{{< details title="Kingdom of Amorlenter (Click to Expand)" >}}

**The Kingdom of Amorlenter**

Executive:  
 King: The King, Ressurect3d, has some limits to power, but there are instances he has power. He has direct permission to call the parliament to order in times of chaos or disorder, he has direct control of the Amorlenti Marine Corps,and  he can declare the banning of certain religions deemed unsafe and dangerous to the state and people.
Originally, we were supposed to have a mock “President”, but most of Amorlenter is Christian or Religious, so a righteous king fits better.

Parliament:  
Parliament: The Parliament, primarily, is made up of a representative from each province of Amorlenter, along with the Ministers and PM respectively. They create the budget for stuff like Military spending, National taxes, and condemnations of Radical/dangerous states.

Ministers: The Ministers control their sovereign portion of the Government. With mainly the Ministers of Education, Military, Treasury, and more getting a single veto when it comes to policies regarding their office. However, Ministers may counter veto to pass a bill off to the PM.

PM: The Prime Minister, normally, will be chosen from a list of candidates, the top 5 are chosen by parliament, and the Prime Minister is chosen by the King. The Prime Minister signs all of the bills and laws on the National scale, along with control of resources of Amorlenter like the church and department of Vexillology.

Department of Education  
Department of Finance  
Department of Military  
Department of Welfare and Health  
Department of Religious control  
Department of Parliamentary Control   
Department of State  
Department of Wildlife and Agriculture  

Symbols:  
 Amorlenter has numerous symbols indigenous to the land, Four being the National animal (The Ram), the Coat of Arms, the Flag, and our National Personification.
 
Ram: The Ram was chosen as a sign of toughness and dexterity, along with Rams fitting into the natural hills and mountains of Amorlenter and their people. Rams, although protected, are allowed to be domesticated and made pets if properly licensed and cared for. If not properly licensed or cared for, they will be confiscated till further notice.

Coat of Arms: The Coat of Arms is a green-beige-green hill landscape with a wreath. The two green hills signifying the mountainous/hilly protection around Amorlenter, and the beige hill representing the wheat and grain fields that fill our Nation. The wreath represents a Amorlenti desire for peace and prosperity with fellow nations and a prosperous future.

Flag: The flag is a tricolor with the Green representing the hills and fertility of Amorlenter, the Beige representing the wheat fields and Agriculture based society, the black stripe resembling our pride for our Country and the sovereign, and the Coat of Arms in the Center is a reminder of our roots and the founding family of Amorlenter.

National Personification: Amorlenter, originally, was known as the Republic of Lahori. Lahori was a violent republic, with little regard for the people and prosperity of the land. So, in late 2022, a revolt took place to overthrow the government. One of the men, Saint Vestigious of Le Château de Dieu, was there as a protestor. He was hit with numerous gas canisters and molotovs, causing burns to the man. But rather than abandon his post and surrender, he stood firm and held out, dawning a green cover and some bandages as he held the spot till more protestors arrived. (God rest his soul).

**Government**

The executive power belongs to the authority of the Sovereign who exercices it within the framework established by the Constitution. The Sovereign is aided by the State Council and the Crown Council. The State Council is mandated to give its advice on matters of laws and regulations. The Crown Council is mandated to give its advice on matters of high interest to the State. It discusses international treaties, the dissolution of the legislature, the naturalization and measures of pardon or amnesty.  
The power of government is exercised, on the authority of the Sovereign, by a Minister of State, helped with the Government Council. The Minister of State represents the Sovereign and is responsible only to them. They preside the Government Council. Regulations and proposals of laws are discussed first in the Government Council. There are 6 ministries : State, Society, Finances, Economy, Territory and Foreign Relations.

__Legislative__  
The legislative power is exercised jointly by the Sovereign and the National Council. The initiation of the law belongs to the Sovereign. The discussion and the vote on laws belongs to the National Council. The promulgation of the laws belongs to the Sovereign. The National Council can make proposals of laws to the Government Council who presents them to the Sovereign before they can be discussed in the National Council. The National Council votes on the budget.

{{< details title="Judicate of Forunes (Click to Expand)" >}}

**The Judicate of Forunes**  
Lagdømet Furunes  
*_Origin_*  
The Judicate is based upon the ancient local Frostatinget, which is thought to be founded **400-600 AD** Frostatinget (Old Norse: Frostuþingslǫg) was a popular assembly, functioning as judicial and legislative. In the 1260s, the laws and bills were written down.  

_Brief introduction_  
The Judicate of Forunes keeps this tradition of Frostatinget with their own  (Furutinget) which was etablished at the date of the foundation of Forunes, 29th of August 2023.  
The Furuting works as a modern replacment of Frostatinget yet immortalizing traditions and laws, such as the idea of 12 men, the so called "motstandsretten" forcing all Forunesians to rebel if the leader is a tyrant, both of these are from the Frostating law.

__Motto__  
The offical motto of Forunes is "**at lögum skal land várt byggja en eigi at ulögum øyða**" (English: (with law shall our land be built, and not desolated by lawlessness) which also is originally from the nearby Frostating law.

__Law__  
As mentioned before the *Furutingslova* Furuting law has its origins in the medieval Frostating law, immortalizing still many laws including the right to fish wherever one please.  
 "Motstandsretten" The right to rebel if the ruler is comiting tyranny or seizing power to himself.
But also norms such as the motion for Forunesians not to swear loyality to the current ruler but rather only to the lawbook itself.  The lawbook, also replicating the medieval lawbook is splitted into "bolka" basically sections divided by different topics. 
The first bolk is the "Tingsfarebolk" which talks about how someone coming to represent a case or work as apart of the jury shall be paid for transporation and other necessary costs. The last section is about taxes.

(First picture illustrates a original copy of medieval Frostating law, while second illustrates the Furuting law digitally, both on same chapter, the former being the ancestor of the latter.)

**__Goverment__**  
Furutinget holds, as per tradition from Frostatinget holds power for both judicial and legislative.  
Furutinget  was granted additionally also executive power, due to the low population and need of a unified unicameral chamber in all three, this was agreed upon in a quick vote amongst Forunesians. The **Lagmann** has power to represent the Judicate of Forunes alone if a crisis was to be struck, such in a act of war or political chaos, though he does not have power to implement decisions which has not been accepted by the Furuting nor revoke any powers of anyone nor grant without the acceptance of the Furuthing court.

Lagmann: Felix Petersøn F. S.  
Viselagmann: Chris Ramsay.  

__Symbols__  
**Patron Saint**  
 is Saint Olaf, who according to saga: After his martyr death in the nearby Battle of Stiklestad (1030) was transported by a farmer through Forunes to his resting place in Trondheim, he was only second to Virgin Mary the most important and most cultivated Holy person in all of Norway, if not the Nordics.  
**National Founder** The mythical founder of Forunes is Olve/Aulvir (according to historians, fl. between 500-600), whom according to local folklore conquered Forunes and lands surronding and is seen as a "restorer." An nearby grave mound is called "Aulvirshaug" and is where the founder rests today. Aulvir's role as a founder can be compared to Charlemagne's role in Andorra.  
**National dish** The national dish is Sodd, an soup dish made out of mutton and vegetables. It was mentioned already in 13th century.  
**National mythical creature** Is a sea serpent in the Trondheimsfjord, mentioned on a map already in 1555, it usually attacks people who makes it mad (such as  blacksmith Jørn Hovde) the serpent also  "spread the black plague to a village due to serpent's bad smell."  
**National drink** Beer and Mead 🍻👍

{{< details title="Þeiod av Þe Markomanas (Click to Expand)" >}}

**__Þeiod av Þe Markomanas__**

Þe Markomanas are a complex chiefdom of the Germanic tribal variety. As such, this means that governance is all about a complex social web of oaths and favors, and therefore is a very fluid and flexible system.

**Raiksing**

The high chief of Þe Markomanas is one who has the respect, sway, or prowess to win over the families, villages, and smaller tribes of our people. It's through sway and prowess, as the refounder of the tribe, that Bakar Deransonu av Hus Muhlnaz claims the title of kunihg.

Beneath a kunihg, there would be a haritoga, who if independent would be known as an erl. An erl is generally someone who has oathbond over any number of village leaders, and has organized them into a tribe together.

A village's leader is typically a þeigen, though if independent would be called a hedman. This leader has oathbond over several families who work in fields of land he owns, and have protections and rights guaranteed by their þeigen/hedman.

**Þing**

The general way things get done in the tribe, no matter what level of organization, is through a þing. A þing is an assembly, where all the men of the given village (with some exceptions) vote on current issues presented or discuss goings on. A þing is typically held every Tiwasdeig (Tuesday), as that is the day of Tiwa, who is kunihg of the gods.

In the event that the organization level is high enough to have a kunihg, and stays organized long enough, an Alþing may be called. Traditionally, a given Hus may reign as kunihg for 3 generations; father, son, grandson. After this, an Alþing is called, where the men of the tribe vote on the next ruling Hus or vote to dissolve their dependence instead. Whomever is the Hus head to take over will inherit all oaths the previous kunihg had, and must live up to them or face backlash.

**Oathbond**

One of the most important things in Markomanihsh society is oaths. By promising to another that you will serve, or protect, or any number of things your social sway and influence will only grow. Even someone as low as a gebur, a simple citizen farmer, may have oaths that boost his standing beyond fending for himself.

Oaths and favors make up the backbone of the transfer of power, and its accumulation. Gain enough land, sway, and fame? You might see yourself becoming someone important some day.

Oaths are expected to be held to the best ability at all times, with no exception. Anyone who breaks their oath is an oathbreaker, and unless forgiveness is formally given, this results in shunning.

**Teknas**

Þe Markomanas have few things that represent them as a whole people, preferring to go by Hus and by individual smaller tribe for what they hold close. Further, we are not an abstract symbolic people, preferring representative over abstract arts.

However, there are popular things that can be considered as representing tribal culture as a whole. For instance:

*Gamas*:

The most popular Markomanihsh sports are shangki and stihkubala, both of which were learned from the Wazazei and Kahokya skræling tribes. Shangki involves the rolling of a discoidal stone or a hoop, and depending on if it's the stone or hoop, points are scored by throwing a spear as close as possible to where you believe the stone will stop rolling or by throwing it through the hoop itself. Stihkubala involves sticks with small looped baskets on the end used to catch a ball and handle it, trying to keep it away from the opponents and get it to the opposed team's side; it can be very high-contact and aggressive, as much as shangki can be very competitive. Both sports involve a lot of gambling.

*Dwodmas*:

Every Hus, and every tribe, has a dwodm. A dwodm is more or less a powerful animal that the tribe or Hus derives strength and some social and martial morals from. For instance, Hus Muhlnaz has the dwodm of boar.

**__Simbolos Nacionales__**  
**National Flag**: Our national flag, Nuestra Bandera has had many renditions over the years, with the current one being made very recently. The Gold represents Weath and Agriculture. The Red represents Blood and Patriotism. The Blue represents Exploration and the deep blue sky above. The four stars represent the Founding Fathers of Pabistan.

**Battle Flag**: The War flag of Pabistan, Bandera de Guerra calls back to our Spanish heritage, with it basically being the flag of the Spanish Empire, but in the colors of Pabistan.

**Imperial Seal**: The Imperial Seal of Pabistan is used by The Senate and The Emperor of Pabistan, officiating every piece of paper that comes from their offices. Its prominent symbols include the four stars representing the Four Founders, the double headed eagle representing continuity with the Roman Empire, the Imperial Crown of Pabistan (which needs to be updated) above it, and on the shield is the Chi-Rho symbol which reinforces our Christian nature.

**Coat of Arms:** The Coat of Arms of Pabistan represents the union of its namesake families Pabon & Beguiristain (Pabon + Beguiristain = Pabistan). I don't know what it's emblazon it, but I will eventually write it.

**National Anthem:** The National Anthem is Pictures at An Exhibition: Promenade, this was chosen because this song would always play in the Hall of Glory in Sid Meier's Civilization Revolution, so to me it represents victory and glory.

{{< details title="Kingdom of Eintrachtia (Click to Expand)" >}}

**__Kingdom of Eintrachtia__**

**__Executive__**  
**Monarchy**  
Eintrachtia has an executive monarchy, which means the monarch shares executive power with the Chancellor, both acting as co-heads of the government. The monarch should be accountable to parliament, and holds a seat in both houses for life, but usually does not participate or interfere in the lower house. The monarch is King of Eintrachtia, while simultaneously serving as Sovereign in several Realm states. The monarch is a hereditary title, while the title for the heir to the crown is usually Prince of Polarveinn.

**Chancellery**  
The Chancellor of Eintrachtia is the co-head of government and is the highest ranking civil official in the government. The Chancellor should be accountable to parliament, and is elected by universal suffrage. He than appoints ministers to form a cabinet. The de facto term limit of a Chancellor is 4 years, though officially the term limit is at the monarch’s pleasure. The parliament has the power to sack the Chancellor if the motion is favoured by more than 60% of the Chamber of Deputies (the lower house).

**__Legislative__**  
**Parliament**  
The parliament is the primary legislative body of Eintrachtia. It is a bicameral legislature, the upper house and lower house being the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies respectively.

**Senate**  
The Senate is the upper house of the parliament, has 5 seats, the monarch always occupies one of them, and the rest are appointed by the monarch, usually from the royal family or distinguished aristocrats to form an advisory body similar to the Privy Council. The Senate has little power, being largely ceremonial.

**Chamber of Most Honourable Deputies of the Realm**  
Simply known as the Chamber of the Deputies, it is the lower house and has 20 seats. Representatives of constituencies occupy an amount of seats proportional to their respective population. The representatives are elected by universal suffrage to their local councils, usually representing different parties. Local councils hold the same amount of seats that the constituency hold in parliament. Members of Parliament (MP) are called Deputies of the Realm (DR).

**__The Realm__**  
The Realm is an international organisation comprised of members that hold special relations with Eintrachtia, usually under personal union. It is modelled after the Commonwealth of Nations, hence it is also known by the name Eintrachtian Commonwealth. The King of Eintrachtia is Sovereign of the Realm. Member states of the Realm has high degree of autonomy, having independent governments and legislatures, while sharing the same head of state. The Secretary-General is elected among the heads of governments of member states. A citizen of either one member state is also citizen of all the member states.

**__National symbols__**  
**Flag**  
The national flag of Eintrachtia is a Nordic cross with the colours red, white and blue. The three colours form the cross, where red and blue symbolises Divine Mercy, and white is the Light of God; the three colours also represent the values of liberty, equality, and fraternity.

**Coat of arms**  
The coat of arms of Eintrachtia is the arms of the House of Ballister, a penguin holding a golden sceptre on a blue background, with the Eintrachtian royal crown as crest. Two lion rampant on a platform with the motto of Eintrachtia “Deus Benedicat Patriae”, meaning “God bless our country”. The highest ranking decoration in Eintrachtia, the Order of the Penguin, is also sometimes included.

**National animal**  
The national animal is the penguin. Eintrachtia, originally founded as the State of the Penguins, with its first claims being laid on the Antarctic Peninsula, is fundamentally dedicated to the bird. As depicted on the national coat of arms and one of the former national flags, the penguin is the favourite animal of the monarchy and hence one of Eintrachtia's founding principle is to spread knowledge about how climate change is affecting the penguin, and protecting the bird at all costs.

{{< details title="Kingdom of Pibocip (Click to Expand)" >}}

**Kingdom of Pibocip**

Government:  
The Kingdom of Pibocip is a constitutional monarchy with the monarch being the head of state. The current monarch of Pibocip is King Philip of the House of Pillin. The government, known as “The Assembly of the Government of the Kingdom of Pibocip,” follows a unique parliamentary form of government, in which the Prime Minister serves as the head of government. The current Prime Minister is Mr. Ziobert. The Parliament of consists of two branches: 1. The Assembly of the Ministry, and 2. The Senate. The Assembly of the Ministry is responsible for handling tasks of the State, such as Foreign Ministry, Department of Defense, and the Ministry of the Interior. The Senate consists of five elected individuals as legislators. Aside from the Parliament, there is also the “National Court,” headed by Mr. Falasca, which serves as the judiciary system for the State. The Kingdom is rooted in the social contract theory, Catholic Social Teaching, and practiced using the principle of subsidiarity. Along with the Catholic Church, the Kingdom of Pibocip proclaims that “human life is sacred and that the dignity of the human person is the foundation of a moral vision for society” (USCCB). In understanding this, the people and the state must work together for the common good of all people. Therefore, the citizens of Pibocip have a right and a duty to participate in society and in the governing of the nation. The Kingdom of Pibocip respects and promotes religious freedom, as well as the right and responsibility to follow a well formed conscience. Likewise, although Pibocip does not have an official or state religion, the government does have respect for all religions of good will open to the transcendent. Christianity, particularly Lutheranism and especially Catholicism, plays a special role in Pibocian culture. Although neither the government nor the constitution officially endorse the Catholic Church, Catholic teaching and theology play a particularly important role in society. Concerning the role of the Church and State in a society, Martin Luther King Jr. expressed, echoed by Martin C. Albl, that the Church is neither the master nor the servant of the state but its conscience, guide, and critic. In a sense, the Kingdom of Pibocip seeks to “journey together” with the Catholic Church and all people of good will for the common good of all people and for the Kingdom of God.  

National Symbols:  
National Anthem: “Fair Pibocip”  
National Motto: Lumen Gentium (Latin) “A Light to the Nations.” Pibocip strives to be a model society for the common good of all people.  
National Colors: Red, Black, White  

Coat of Arms:  
Officially Adopted on 11 February 2019, although a variation of the coat of arms has been displayed on the flag since 2000. The crown represents that Pibocip is a monarchy. The banner reading the Latin motto “Lumen Gentium,” in English “A Light to the Nations.” This is taken from Isaiah 42:6 and the Second Vatican Council Document Lumen Gentium. The motto suggests that we are supposed to be a model to the rest of the world (like Jesus). The red star is to represent the light shining out of the darkness. Red is for the blood of the Family, black is for the earth, and white is for the Kingdom of God, which is intended by the Church (and Pibocip) to be shown forth in the world.

Pibocian Flag:  
Originally adopted with the independence of Pibocip on 12 July 2000, it underwent few minor adaptations throughout the years, until the current flag. An earlier version of the flag had a sharper design to the shield instead of the current rounded shield. Besides the few variations, the flag has mostly stayed the same since the original independence design. The current version of the Pibocian flag was ratified on 11 February 2019.
The three red stars represent the three family surnames involved in the royal family of Pibocip (Pillin, Brauer, and Cipriano), as well as the virtues of Faith, Hope, and Love. The black and white represent the “physical” and “metaphysical” reality. The red represents freedom and blood of family. The red, black, and white in the shield represent the same meanings as described in the Coat of Arms description. The forward facing black pennant design represents a forward movement of society, while being rooted in tradition.

The Kingdom of Pibocip has both a National Coat of Arms and a National Flag, while the Pibocian Royal Family has a separate Coat of Arms and Royal Standard. The Pibocian Royal Family’s Coat of Arms is the Coat of Arms of the Pibocian Royal House and Reigning Monarch. The Pibocian Royal House consists of members of the Pillin, Brauer, and Cipriano Families. Individual members of the Pillin, Brauer, and Cipriano Families may have a personal Coat of Arms separate from the Coat of Arms of the Pibocian Royal House and Reigning Monarch. These personal Armorial Bearings may be either variations of or mergers with the Royal Coat of Arms, or the design can be almost completely different from the Royal Coat of Arms.
