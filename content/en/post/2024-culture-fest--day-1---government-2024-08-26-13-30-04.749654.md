__***The Empire of Levina***__

**Executive**

*The Emperor*

Levinia is an absolute monarchy, meaning the Emperor has full control over the country. While we do have the constitution, the Emperor does not need to abide by it, which is said in the constitution. As Head of State and Head of Government, everything is done with the approval of the Emperor. Citizenship is granted and revoked at the discretion of the Emperor. The Emperor signs all diplomatic agreements and normally serves as Minister of Foreign affairs. The Emperor oversees the treasury and all government purchases and events. 

**Imperial Cabinet**

*Prime Minister*

The Prime Minister is picked by the Emperor, or the people can elect it if it is approved by the Emperor and they so wish. The Prime Minister runs the day-to-day government under supervision from the Emperor. The Emperor allows the PM to control the government, appoint ministers, etc.

*Cabinet of Ministers*

Ministry of Economic Affairs and Finance  
Ministry of Foreign Affairs  
Ministry of Internal Affairs  
Ministry of Justice  
Ministry of Defense  
Ministry of Health and Social Welfare  
Ministry of Energy  
Ministry of Culture  
Ministry of Development  
Ministry of the Environment, Agriculture and Natural Resources  
Ministry of Post and Communication  
Ministry of Science, Innovation, and Technology  
Ministry of Education  

**Imperial Parliament**

*The Imperial Senate*

The Imperial Senate (TIS) is a house comprised of only appointed officials, that does not base its members on political parties. The Emperor may appoint anyone he likes to the Senate. It is the upper house in Levinia and debates on everything passed by the House of Representatives, the lower house. Normally they meet together, and collaborate on projects.

*The House of Representatives*

The House of Representatives is the lower, elected house. Unlike the UK and American governments, the elections are held by political parties. Meaning instead of voting for a person, they vote for parties, which then translates to seats held in the House of Reps. So far the monarchist party has the highest approval rating and controls the House of Representatives. Party leaders select those who seem fit to serve. 

**Constitution**

Levinia has a constitution that outlines how the country should be ran and how it functions. It includes instructions on Parliament, the Cabinet, etc. The constitution, unlike most, does not include human rights as that is passed by bills. The Levinian Constitution is just an instruction on government and less about rights. 

**Symbols**

Our **national mythical creature** is a two-headed half-eagle half-dove bird. The heads looking west and east represent Levinia's desire to expand around the globe. The eagle side represents Levinian fierceness and the dove represents our peacemaking abilities. 
Our **national bird** is the Bluebird, which lives around Levinia and in the Imperial Palace itself.
