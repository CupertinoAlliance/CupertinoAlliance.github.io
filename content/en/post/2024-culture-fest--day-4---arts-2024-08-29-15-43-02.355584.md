**The Kingdom of Amorlenter**

Languages:  
Amorlenter, as expected in Fr*nce, has a primary language of French. However, a lot of our population speak English, and a dialect of French simply known as Amorlenti French, which has lower emphasis on the accented vowels along with a harder roll on the R than common French.

Arts:  
The arts are fairly big in Amorlenter, with a third of our population (11 people) being artists to  a degree. The now Ex-Prime Minister, BODEGA, runs a successful theater company within Amorlenter. We also have a high emphasis on arts relating to Religion and warfare, especially on the Christian saints given our mostly Christian population.

Literature:  
The Amorlenti people, oddly enough, have a strong sense of artistic fervor in literature, with most being about romance and compassion for the land and people. The King even has a passion for writing, although not the best poet, he does love to write poems about Nationalism and a common identity under the Arms of Amorlenter and their family.

**__Þe Markomanas__**

**__Tuhngwas__**

Þe Markomanas mainly speak two languages, those being Markomanihsh and English, with a specific focus on the Ozarks English dialect. The Markomanihsh language uses a typical Germanic alphabet, consisting of 33 runes, which would be rendered as ᛫ᚠᚢᚦᚩᚱᚳ᛫ (fuþeirk) if treated the same way as the other ancient Germanic alphabets.

**__Lihsti__**

Þe Markomanas are, as many Germanic tribes in history, not particularly inclined towards what many would consider fine arts. While favoring and honoring poetry and poets themselves, and holding to traditions of certain artistic expression, much of the more material art is very representative; by and large, Germanic cultures in the past were not abstract symbolists until after their Christianization.

**__Buukas__**

While the members of the tribe are expected to be literate, unlike the majority of our predecessors, we do not have any works of literature. Most of our stories thus far are oral, and the first to even begin writing them down and recording them is me; this includes the family stories that inspired me to try and refound the tribe.

{{< details title="Kingdom of Eintrachtia (Click to Expand)" >}}

**__Kingdom of Eintrachtia__**

**Arts**  
Arts in Eintrachtia is big. Data shows that 4 out of 5 Eintrachtians can draw, and about 33% of all Eintrachtians practices art-related professions. The King’s maternal grandmother is a retired artist, while the King himself studying in architecture, practices Chinese calligraphy and painting in his leisure time. Not less than 20% of all Eintrachtians could play at least one musical instrument.

Eintrachtia has its own College of Arms as well as a Vexillological Institute.

**Languages**  
The official languages in Eintrachtia are Chinese, English, Latin and Portuguese. Having a 100% literacy rate, most if not all Eintrachtians could read and write more than two languages. Not less than 20% of all Eintrachtians are trilingual, with some being able to understand two to three more languages to some extent. Eintrachtia has its own constructed language, it was a project initiated by King John prior to becoming a micronationalist, it has gone through several notable changes before reaching its current form. The Eintrachtian language is currently very seldomly used, and therefore only receives the title as a recognised language rather than incorporating it into the official language family.

**Rovia**

Languages:  
Rovians speak Arabic, as expected. Egyptian Arabic is the normal day to day dialect used, although formally, only Modern Standard Arabic is used. Interestingly, there is a new dialect that is slowly being formed by some citizens of Rovia. Around 15% of Rovians speak Gulf Arabic, while 10% speak Libyan Arabic. Turkish, Italian, and Greek are recognized minority languages, with around 18% speaking them. Coptic is not used in everyday language but is used as the liturgical languages of the Churches found in Rovia.

Arts:  
Every 4 years a national Art Exhibition is held in Rovia to award citizens who provide artistic work that betters the cultural advancements of Rovia. This year the first ever exhibition was conducted, and the following artworks were awarded:

**Hiperia**
                                                                                                                       Arts in Hiperia are more about the art of sport rather than art are so we have a yearly competition at 1 of our provinces and it normally involves fencing, a woods race, the track dash, and climbing, with others coming soon.  we mainly speak English though there are a few Russian, Spanish, and French speakers. again we don't have many arts so i cant show case them but 1 person has written a book so I'll see if I can find it.
