{{< details title="Þe Markomanas (Click to Expand)" >}}

**__Þe Markomanas__**

**__Kauping__**

Þe Markomanas trade using material commodities and precious metal coins/bullion. Currently, there are no major imports or exports, as we have no certain trading partners. However, we are currently growing cotton and a nitrogen-fixing breed of maize, and are willing to trade with any group who can provide the right price or goods.

As of now, the main job in our tribe is farming. The only workforce is also the leadership, being myself.

**The Kingdom of Amorlenter**

Imports:  
Amorlenter has a few imports, mainly resources like airsoft rounds and armory, along with seeds for various plants like tomatoes, potatoes, and wheat.

Exports:  
Amorlenter has a main economy on crafts and Rose production. We also have an affinity for education based economics, with stuff like Crucifixes, Rosaries,  and religious images being made here.

Work Force:  
Most of our workforce is men, mainly in agricultural production or the armed forces, with a small percentage working in the industrial sector for Amorlenter.
 Meanwhile Women make a majority of the Industrial sector along with crafts and religious charity work.

Main Jobs:  
As expected, Amorlenter’s main jobs are stuff like farmers, soldiers, and crafters who primarily make up our economy. It also has to be noted that we don’t have a sailing corps yet but we are working on getting one for international trade.

{{< details title="Hiperia (Click to Expand)" >}}
**Hiperia**


We have a small work force of farmers and crafters along with others in the military and revolve around a currency known as the H.

Imports: we don't have many just 3d printer plastic and some seeds but besides there ain't much.

Exports: we sell small arms to out citizens and trade our currency for USD so they can use them for purchases in the shops here along with places outside the capital.

Our workforces has farmers, crafters, some people that will exchange USD for the H, military,  government officials, and about 3 people who have 1 small restraint shop but we don't have a main job everyone contributes equally.

{{< details title="Principality of Sancratosia (Click to Expand)" >}}
**Principality of Sancratosia**

Sancratosia operates with a limited economic base, heavily dependent on the personal fortune of the House of Sancratosia. Economic activities primarily consist of handmade products and service industries, with minimal exports and a reliance on imported goods. The Principality's main export product is postage stamps. Public spending is a cornerstone of economic development in Sancratosia.

__Taxes__  
The tax system in Sancratosia includes a 25% value-added tax (VAT) applied to most goods and services, with prices typically inclusive of VAT. There is no income tax imposed on citizens.

{{< details title="Kingdom of Eintrachtia (Click to Expand)" >}}

**__Kingdom of Eintrachtia__**

The Eintrachtian economy is heavily dependent on the royal household, as most of the Eintrachtian population are members of the ruling house.

**Currency**  
Eintrachtia has a long history of developing currencies, mainly due to the fact that the founder and current monarch of the nation, King John, is a numismatist. The official currency of Eintrachtia is the _Pound_. Prior to the founding of the Penguins State, a predecessor to modern Eintrachtia, King John and his father had developed a currency for the continent of Antarctica after being inspired by other similar attempts. In August 2019, the first paper note featuring a transparent plastic window was introduced. These notes often featured penguins, the national animal. Notes produced in this period were mostly hand drawn by King John and his father as a hobby, both being enthusiasts in numismatics and stamp collecting. The notes of the Penguins State were never legal tender in the nation but served as foundation stones for future development in the Eintrachtian currency.

The first official sets of Eintrachtian banknotes were printed by the Bank of Eintrachtia between 16 and 17 March 2022, both of the two sets of 100 pound notes were printed on large sheets and were never cut and distributed, and remain in the royal collection while occasionally being displayed at the National Museum.

**Stamps**  
Stamp collection is a huge culture in Eintrachtia. However, only one set of stamps was ever produced by Eintrachtia. The stamps, published by the Penguins State (likely between 2017-2018) featured penguins, and had a face value of one (Penguinsian) dollar each. It is also one of the oldest remaining physical documentation of Middle Penguinsian (Old Eintrachtian), a constructed language used in Eintrachtia; the usage of the language can be see on the face value titled “UN DULLAR” (one dollar). The set remains in the royal collection.
