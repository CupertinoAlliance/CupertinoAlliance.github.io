*21 days have passed since the founding of the Cupertino Forum. So far, the Forum includes 16 delegates across 13 member states. The https://cupertino.forum blog has been created and the Nutmeg program has been enhanced to bridge the gap between discord and the blog, helping members easily publish professional-looking news articles about their nation's development. Twin Towns has been enhanced as well, intending to serve as a catalyst for members to take their diplomatic relationships to the next level. New Athens and Levinia have already twinned their capitals and are planning cultural exchanges as a result. Tyler Mullins was elected to be the Programs Secretary. The Events Secretary position is still vacant, but nominations are open.*

## Cupertino Forum Opens Doors, Eliminates Membership Requirement

Forum members consider the start of the forum to have been a success, but arrived at the conclusion that the best long-term course of action is to completely open the forum to the public. **Anyone can join and participate in the forum as an individual and instead of filling out an application to join the forum, you simply have meet the following requirements**:

1. Applicants must be a citizen of a micronation.
2. Applicants must have a discord account.
3. Applicants must not be in violation of the discord terms of service.
4. Applicants must not pose a safeguarding risk or other risk towards members of the Cupertino Forum, or associate closely with those who do.

**What We Offer:**
- Collaboration channels for various topics on micronationalism, such as diplomacy, culture, design, physical development, economy, technology, micro-law, government and military. We also have a few channels for general and off-topic discussion.
- Various diplomatic and nation-building programs, such as the Twin Towns diplomatic program, the Nutmeg blog, and Cupertino Guides.
- Events are on the horizon too. The first monthly summit will be scheduled soon, with more events to come once the Events Secretary has been elected.
