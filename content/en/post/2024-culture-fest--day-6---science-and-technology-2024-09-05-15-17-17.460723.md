Day 6 is about __science and technology__! Participants showcased examples of research or technological innovation produced by their citizens or government.  Each submission can be found below.

{{< details title="New Athens (Click to Expand)" >}}

New Athens's main scientific endeavor is the New Athens Space Technology and Aerospace Research department. 

On April 5, 2021, the New Athens Space Technology and Aerospace Research department was formed. The main objective of the department has been to oversee atmospheric and space observations. It also oversees existing and future national weather stations. Read about it and stay updated on projects and findings on the NASTAR wiki page at https://micronations.wiki/wiki/New_Athens_Space_Technology_and_Aerospace_Research

**Continuous Missions**

__National Weather Stations__  
The NADAA has taken over the oversight of all national weather stations of the Free Nation of New Athens. There is currently one active national weather station. 
__Rare Interstellar Event Reporting__  
The NADAA documents and reports on rare interstellar events. This includes but is not limited to meteor showers, rare comets, and rare lunar and solar events.
__Meteor Observation__  
The NADAA monitors and reports on meteor showers. It keeps a calendar of all expected meteor showers each year and provides guides for the best viewing of each.  
These events are shared in the [New Athens discord server](https://discord.gg/DfvBbcV) 24 hours in advance and can also be accessed on [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=ZWQxY2M4NDdiMDYxNDg3MWUxYTIwYmY4OTBkNThkMmRkODJhYTM0ODU0ZTQwM2NlNzViNDM4NTU1NDc3ZTJkM0Bncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t) so anyone can view and/or subscribe to it to add it to their own calendar.

**Special Projects**

__Satellite Imagery__  
This project includes the creation of antennas to receive photographic data of Earth from NOAA, GOES and METEOR-M2 satellites.

__Project Eagle Eye__  
Project Eagle Eye is the first rocketry mission initiated by the New Athens Space Technology and Aerospace Research (NASTAR), aiming to launch a model rocket with the dual objectives of capturing high-resolution aerial photography and videography and reaching an altitude of 2,640 feet (1/2 mile) above sea level. The mission is scheduled for the week of Thanksgiving, 2024, and will utilize advanced rocketry components and imaging technology to achieve its goals.

On April 12, 2021, NASTAR was invited to join the International Aerospace Community. The IAC is an organization of micronational space agencies.

New Athens won the 2021 Cupertino Alliance Science & Technology Award due to the progress of the Satellite Imagery Project.
