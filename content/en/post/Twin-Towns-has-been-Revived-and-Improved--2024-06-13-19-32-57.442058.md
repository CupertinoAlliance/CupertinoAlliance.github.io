## Twin Towns has been Revived and Improved!

*The Twin Towns program aims to unite member nations through the pairing of cities and towns, creating diplomatic and cultural relations and boosting them where they currently exist. The primary objective of the program include developing settlements by pairing them with similar cities, creating long-lasting bonds between settlements and nations, encouraging growth and partnerships within paired cities and nations.*
## Improvements
In this iteration of the program, the process has become fully automated, empowering member states to easily twin their towns with other members. 
### Usage
`/twin [your nation] [your town] [another nation] [their town] [delegate of their nation]`
*NOTE: The command is only enabled  in #twin-towns*

When this command is run, the bot pings `[delegate of their nation]` and provides ✅ and ❌ for them to approve or deny the twin request. The request will time out after 5 minutes.
If the request is approved, a PDF certificate will be auto-generated and posted by the bot. 
Below the twin towns agreement between Cardinalia (New Athens) and Imperia (Levinia) as an example.
