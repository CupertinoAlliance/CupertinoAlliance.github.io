> This system was invented by [King Tyler Mullins](https://micronations.wiki/wiki/Tyler_Mullins_of_New_Athens) of [New Athens](https://micronations.wiki/wiki/Free_Nation_of_New_Athens) in order to quantify the development level of a given micronation based on standard expectations and equity on a 0-100 numerical scale. The number of citizens, size of territory and annual budget are not included in this scale, as these factors can not often be easily changed and do not have a significant impact on the ability for a micronation to become an established, respected and professional micronation within the community. Any micronation which meets the below requirements would exceed the requirements of the [1933 Montevideo Convention on the Rights and Duties of States](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montevideo_Convention) and would likely be seen as a developed and professional micronation by many members of the community.
> 
> This index is designed to be a yes/no checklist, with each item being worth a set number of points, totaling 100.

Now, in addition to the [previously provided google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bCQdYJZvS2QgPzv7vMOel9wKImSOCRdk) calculator, [This auto-scoring Google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfp4iw7QskV6YxQBpedY-uYCzesfx_hQuPWwTxNXvPiIRVwPA/viewform?usp=sf_link) can now be used to easily score a micronation on this scale.
