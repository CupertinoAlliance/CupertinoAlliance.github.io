*Originally a 2020-era discord server for sharing member news, Nutmeg has evolved into a full blog of member news.*

A [custom website](https://github.com/CupertinoAlliance/CupertinoAlliance.github.io) found at https://www.cupertino.forum and a [discord bot](https://github.com/NewAthensGov/DiscordBlog) have been created by Tyler Mullins of New Athens. Cupertino Forum members have access to the bot and can run the /news command in #member-news to publish news articles directly to the blog from discord in under a minute.
This program allows members to have an official blog for sharing news, without having to build/buy and run their own blog. Plus, it's all done conveniently through discord.

### Usage
`/news title author image text link(optional)`
*NOTE: This command is only enabled in #member-news*

Include the title of the article, the author, a link to an image to accompany it, and the text of the blog post, formatted in markdown (discord formatting). Optionally, you can also include an external link, which will be automatically included at the bottom of the blog post. Examples of links could include related social media posts or a link to a related post on your national blog, if you have one.

As mentioned, the formatting for the text of the post should be done using [markdown, which is what discord text formatting uses](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/210298617-Markdown-Text-101-Chat-Formatting-Bold-Italic-Underline), so it should be familiar. There is no character limit, so I recommend typing up the blog post in discord or a text editor, then just pasting it all into the text spot in the /news command.

### If you want to include headers and/or line breaks in your post, you need to do it on mobile!
When you paste your text into the command on desktop, line breaks are automatically removed and doing shift+enter [does not work on desktop](https://github.com/discord/discord-api-docs/issues/2381), but it DOES work on mobile using the return button on your phone keyboard. 

If you need to make edits to your blog post after it's submitted, contact Tyler Mullins (@darkstar1592).
