**__Þe Markomanas__**

**__Markomanshidu__**

Þe Markomanas hold a culture and religion that are inseperable from one another. Most aspects of daily life are tied in some way to the religion, and this general way of life is referred to as Markomanshidu (meaning Markoman-Way). The general worldview is animistic and polytheistic, with a belief in 3 worlds: Hefonraik, the world where the gods and their race live; Manahaim (also called Medlraik), where mankind and most other things live; and Helyo, the underworld where the dead reside. The expression "9 worlds" is not literal, referring to the entirety of existence, as 9 is the foremost sacred number of all Germanic tribes and their faiths, also including 3 and any multiples of 3 and 9.

Irmihnsul, the World-Pillar, is the axis mundi of Markomanshidu; it supports the 3 worlds, and is connected to the beginning and end of the current creation. The world is cyclical, to a believer of Markomanshidu, and this is only the first cycle; there will be more, ever and onwards, for as many times as there can be.

There are many gods, but chief amongst them is Tiwa, who reigns as their kunihg. He is the son of Eisten, who did not wish to rule, for he sang his brother's willingly sacrificed flesh into existence so others could enjoy it and find meaning. Tiwa and his brothers, Woden and Valþen, are 3 of the most often called upon gods.

Honor is among the foremost goods one can have, as are the virtues the sexes are expected to uphold. Masculine virtue is seen to have been handed down by the goddess Werkusti, who stated the utmost good men are those who follow her guidance; the virtues of women are seen as inherited from the example of Ansu women and their actions. Individuality is highly and fiercely important, with families and their interior beliefs meshing into and forming local practice with other families in a tribe. Shared culture and belief are important, but only if done as individuals and never as an obedient whole.

Worship and prayer is best done outdoors, in sacred groves or near sacred waterways and bogs; worship indoors is typically for housewights, whereas that done outdoors is for landwights and the gods themselves. Most worship is given to wights (spelled wait in Romanized Markomanihsh), a word meaning "living thing" or "critter", who are most involved in people's likes from day to day. They tend to have greater sway over the world, and therefore better magic, than the gods because they directly came from Yumu's flesh as it was sang into the world; the gods, despite having weaker magic, are generally seen as their rulers due to existence being their uncle.

{{< details title="Kingdom of Amorlenter (Click to Expand)" >}}

**The Kingdom of Amorlenter**

Holidays:  
Amorlenter has many religions, mostly Christian religions like Lent, Christmas, and Easter. But we do have holidays other than those such as New Hill day, for the Grand Hill offensive, and le jour du mariage, day of the wed. On le jour du mariage, all married couples don’t have work and are free to enjoy life (so long as it doesn’t cause strife to others).

Customs:  
Amorlenti people have a few notable customs, one of which is, on the top of the entry door frame of your home, you have a symbol of your religion (Christians have crosses, Muslims a Star and Crescent, etc etc). The Amorlenti people also tend to keep their weapons close to their doors in case of emergency.

Beliefs:  
Despite having religion, Amorlenter had mythology before it. Two of which are that, in seasons of drought, you’d make an offering to God and say a prayer in French known as la prière de salut rapide. Another belief is that people, when born, are at their highest potential to find their passion. So in order to find it, Amorlenter has a system where families bring their newborn to a facility (With the parents involved of course) and the newborn would be tested to find what caused increased dopamine and serotonin production for the child.

Aspects of Life & Principles:  
People in Amorlenter operate socially under a corporatist caste, in which a child at birth would be assigned to their passion group. In which they’d stay there till adulthood, when they can apply to change groups or apply for promotions. Amorlenter also, as a whole, has a high respect for the religious elders, be them monks, rabbis, or imam. Along with that, sexualization or attempted sexual conduct with female figures meant to be abstinent and celibate will be forced to pay a fine and forced to be in jail for a month. If a person r*pes a celibate figure, they will be put to death by chemical castration till they cannot move.

Symbols:  
Symbols of Amorlenter are few in between, but we have a few unique ones.   The first is the Latin cross with a gold wreath, symbolizing Amorlenter’s Christian populace and the fertility and youth of our church.  
Another symbol of Amorlenter is the virgin Mary. Despite not being native to Amorlenter, we hold her dear to us and the young women of Amorlenter’s churches, mosques, and synagogues.

{{< details title="Principality of Sancratosia (Click to Expand)" >}}
**Principality of Sancratosia**

**Customs**  
__Holidays__  
Sancratosia is a secular state and although it follows a "Western" calendar where holidays are usually related to Christian holidays, they are usually renamed or changed into fixed days to ensure certain "stability" in the calendar. For instance, Easter is replaced by two distinct holidays, Elefen Language Day (21 March), celebrating the official language of Sancratosia and 1Duchess Maria I Day (15 April), celebrating the honorific founder of Sancratosia. Most holidays exist to celebrate cultural elements such as Chives Day (10 June), Independence Day (1 December), George Boeree Day (15 January). Most months have holidays, only July and August have none. Other days, called notable days, highlight elements of Sancratosian culture or humankind achievements but are not days where people take a day off.

__Greetings__  
Sancratosia's official language is the Lingua Franca Nova (LFN), an auxiliary language that most people, even citizens, speak. But, as a defining element of Sancratosian culture and a mark of identity, it is customary to use the LFN greetings in conversations amongst citizens. The widespread use of "Saluta", or "Alo" as the usual greetings and the use of "Adio", "Asta revide" or "Txau" as the send-offs fosters the sense of community in the Principality's places of discussion.

__Cuisine__  
Sancratosian cuisine is a fusion cuisine influenced by Quebecois, French, and American culinary traditions. It also incorporates representative dishes of global cuisines, like Japanese, Italian, etc.

**Beliefs**  
__Principles__  
The Sancratosian core values and principles are what guides the policies and the general administration of the Principality, such as Diversity, Respect, Peace, Creativity, Knowledge, Communication, Collegiality, Democracy and Justice. Citizens have to adhere to these principles to be naturalized. Human rights are considered to be at the heart of the motivation for the foundation of the Principality.

__Lifestyle__  
Sancratosians should be able to relate to each other even if not living next to each other. Apart from the official language, which is a defining element of Sancratosian culture and lifestyle, lifestyle that is adopted in Sancratosia must be replicated, to a certain degree, in more than one place in the world. For instance, it would not be acceptable to have a tradition to play ice hockey once a year for it would be difficult for certain people to participate in that tradition, it is however acceptable to have the tradition of eating chicken/turkey/duck on Goose Day. This is always subject to appreciation and interpretation but, efforts must be made to make it as accessible as possible. There is some exception for certain traditions which can be found on the ceremonial territory (ie, in Québec) for, should control of the territory be gained, Quebecois culture would likely remain. All these considerations is the reason why Chives were chosen as the national flower, since it can grow almost anywhere, most Sancratosian citizens would be able to make it grow at home and enjoy the national flower at home.

__Religion__  
As a secular state, there is no official religion in Sancratosia. Freedom of cults is guaranteed in the Constitution and discrimination based on religious beliefs is forbidden. Religious demographics roughly mirrors global trends. There are some talks on establishing an official church in Sancratosia based on the principles of Unitarian Universalism or, at the very least, an official center of worship.
