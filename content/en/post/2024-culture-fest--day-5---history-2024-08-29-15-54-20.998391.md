**__La Histoire de l’Amorlenter__**  
**__Chapitre 1: Formation of the Republic__**  
What we currently think of as “Amorlenter” was not known as that. It all started in early 2019 (Man I feel old) when a young man by the username of Resurrected joined a minecraft states server, where he made the  Kingdom of Frostland, which was conquered by the Community Patriotic Pigs United. 
 
Despite the events, he held no resentment towards them, forming the nation of New Frostland in a forest thousands of miles south of the PPU. He lived there peacefully with his people and his pet dogs. It was only a month or so into a project when hell unfolded on the poor man’s fledgling empire. At around 5:43 P.M., on July 12th, Resurrected was kidnapped and held hostage in the PPU capital. 

Thankfully, he escaped with the aid of a rebellious member of the PPU. It took hours of time, but he returned to his capital… or what was left of it….  
He found his people slain, blood coating the walls of his once humble city, his pets slain by the river as they turned a deep scarlet that scars him to this day.  
It was the equivalent of a massacre, and as he put it “I only saw this much bloodshed when war reached fever points, but this can be our modern Boston Massacre.” -Resurrected on the slaughter of New Frostland.

Enraged at this betrayal and hatred he faced, he claimed:
“People of the world, look upon me not in pity or reverence, but fear. For I can promise two things for you. For those men and women of the PPU have not only angered the deceased of my land but the wrath of God himself. May your kin fall not by my iron or the gunpowder you used to murder my families, but may God’s Plagues crash upon you like a horde upon the peasantry…”

After relocation to a foreign island, he formed Novania as a rebel state to harm the PPU. A parasite to a host. He continued, saying:  
 “I do not care what those swine (PPU people) say about me. They can burn my idols and images of my God, but their nation is that of a forgotten age. A collapsing giant, and I am not some knight in shining armor, but a scourge. A plague for their people, for it is by my hand they will burn, and it is by my hand their empire will fall harder and faster than any before”.

**__Chapitre 2: Changing of the colors.__**  
After numerous raids against the PPU, Novania grew and grew. Becoming stronger and stronger. They totaled around 5 players, 3 of which being soldiers in diamond armor, for the war effort. President Resurrected had this to say:  
 “Our war with the PPU is nearly over, for their blood will run stale and thin by the end of our night and by the bombing of their capital”.

After days of travel, they arrived at the capital of the PPU, where one rising Captain (TornGraveDigr) would aid in the bombing of numerous homes, trade centers, a castle for LGBTQ refugees that harbored numerous bombs, and the fields of sugar they had.

No casualties were recorded, but there was mass destruction. By the end of the night, the city was nothing but ash as they left.

After a few weeks, they changed servers, Resurrected took the helm again with his friend Torn as his VP and the third big figure, BODEGA, as his minister of Agriculture.  Novania grew and grew, but then one of the big revolts of the era happened.

**-The Domoy Revolts**  
A new member of the republic named Chikn was a fan of the law system of Novania, which had a high emphasis on freedom with safety. But as they grew, Chikn became more and more territorial and possessive of his claims of land known as “The Domoy colonies”. Domoy grew and grew, to the point it was a second home from the Novanian capital of Ryderos.

One night, however, Chikn murdered Torn in the city streets for stealing a Golden apple and horse armor. Soon more and more people complained about his possessive tendencies and hoarding nature. So, at the discretion of President Ressurected, Chikn was put under house arrest. 

He served it, but the tension grew as a tower war ensued. Novania won after the bombing of the Domoy tower. However, one night Torn found that Chikn had left to form his own country in rebellion to oppose Novania. 

The only trace of his exit? The burning of their tower, along with their declaration of independence and national dog, Vestige. This, as President Res put, was an act of war irredeemable and must be punished. Before he could go on the war path however, an error in their maintenance in the water supply poisoned most of their war horses and dogs, thankfully they repopulated swiftly and went to war. The trek was treacherous and long, but after around 14 days of trial and numerous malfunctions and horse deaths, they made it to the fledgling Domoy. 

Domoy only had a house to its name, and a pyramid which harbored the Novanian Army as they lay and waited.  On a crisp September morning in 2020, they started the battle of Domoy. It was a swift battle, and it actually ended fairly civilly. Amorlenter was reimbursed for Domoy independence, and gave aid to Domoy after they pledged to be a protectorate for a few months.

After the whole Domoy revolt, a new player by Phoenix tried to make a desert region known as Kinostera a independent state, to which he was only made the governor which satisfied his craving for power. Clauve’ia, another new state made by BODEGA, actually gained independence, until they merged back with Novania for financial reasons. 

After the events on Minecraft, they started the real life nation, only to rebrand to the Republic of Lahori in early 2021. Lahori was silent, with little to no action and events.

However, the people changed. Ressurected left, replaced by Yaga (Deadli on Discord), BODEGA became an artist for Lahori, Torn became a general for the armed forces, and a friend of BODEGA named Shroomy joined as a farmer.

 
**__Chapitre 3: New leaf, New King__**  
By late 2022, the people were fed up with how Lahori was doing nothing to grow or advance. So, to combat this, they pushed for more minecraft (Which failed), they then tried the Gustavian initiative, which restructured the government and also failed horribly for the government.

In early 2023, numerous people were forming a group known as the VHP (Vestige Harvest Party) which advocated for two main things: A return to a Constitutional Monarchy and a state with added religion. 

Originally, the people didn’t unite, since the then president G4von took away the right to assembly. However, major figures for the transformation to Amorlenter were Yaga, BODEGA, and Shroomy. The three became pillars of the community and grew in notoriety, especially BODEGA for her art abilities and propaganda.

In October and November, the St. Damas revolts surged in Amorlenter, taking resources to turn the city to the VHP. Vestige was a unity point, a sign of a better time and a unifying time that Yaga wished to return to.  
So, in early November, they went on the war path to reclaim Lahori and turn it to Amorlenter.  
They fought two battles: In St. Damas and the old capital of Stradusben, both of which VHP victories. By the 26th of November, the war was all but won. 

The treaty of LMDD (Le Main de Dieu) ended the official war, with the restoration of the Constitutional Monarchy. Yaga took up the helm as King for the Kingdom, BODEGA became PM, and Shroomy became the Minister of wildlife and agriculture, with Torn became the minister of war.

However, on the 13th of December, the first Amorlenti flag was raised as the people cried and celebrated. People prayed to their Gods and welcomed the new king and PM to the society.  
Immediately stuff grew, they got more power and arms, grew in agriculture, adopted the Ram as their national animal, and grew in notoriety among Micronations globally (To a small amount).

That isn’t to say it was a perfect Kingdom. The PM, BODEGA, and King, Yaga, were conflicting as BODEGA became more and more liberal, pushing for a modern Areligious state and more LGBTQ rights, which the heavily Religious populous didn’t want for obvious reasons.

Numerous of her Left-Wing bills flew past and failed as Yaga shot them down. It culminated in Early June of this year as BODEGA, fed up with the Kingdom and their conservative ideals, quit her title as PM and left Amorlenter as a Micronationalist.

It isn’t clear what happened after her disappearance, but Amorlenter is growing slowly and steadily. With even the King having high hopes for the Nation to grow and become better known for being a beacon of Religious growth in the community with the church of Amorlenter.

{{< details title="Þe Markomanas (Click to Expand)" >}}

**__Þe Markomanas__**

**__Gistrlor__**

The origins of Þe Markomanas is something shrouded in ancient history, myths, and recent events. The earliest origins of the Markomanihsh people lies with the Ald Markomanas (Marcomanni/Markomanniz) of Antiquity. Over time, mixture with tribes like the Sæksonwas (Saxons) and the Baiaweras (Baiuvari) caused a distinct cultural split.

By the end of the Freinkowiga (the Saxon Wars), the ancestors of Þe Markomanas had already begun to diverge a great deal. Going into hiding as the rest of Europe turned to Christianity, the Markomanihsh people split apart to travel the world, vowing to meet again in a select few locations again one day.

At the time they finally met back up, they had learnt much, and decided to set off to find a land told of in fables: Haimarikislænd, a land far to the west that the god Haimariki and his host of men had discovered. Enthralled by tales of fierce Skræling tribes, and endless unspoiled bounty, they stowed upon the first ships that they could and sailed across the briney deep.

After reaching Haimarikislænd, the tribe departed for the interior, sailing rivers and climbing the hills and mountains in their way. Finally, after meeting and fighting and trading with many tribes of Skrælingas, they made it to the interior, to a place they call Wazazark (the Ozarks), where the tribe of the Wazazei lived.

After learning much from the Wazazei, they had a time of relative peace. Eventually, the United States encompassed the area, and as Ozarker culture settled fully in, most of the Markomanihsh absorbed into the population.

Those who recalled stories, though, would pass them on; this is how Bakar Deransonu av Hus Muhlnaz would decide to refound the tribe. Hearing old stories of myths and legends, of gods the people barely remembered hidden inside, and of struggles half-legendary.

Now, as of 10 years ago, Þe Markomanas has been reborn.

{{< details title="Hiperia (Click to Expand)" >}}

**Hiperia**

The oligarchical Empire of Hiperia consists of three observer states for provinces eight territories and several allies. The current head of state is Itwaoxfa.

When the oligarchical empire of Hiperia was founded. It was just called Hiperia.

Hiperia was founded in 2002 by the great king Akobja He started the micro nation as a sort of religious group so that his religion Panthon could have a nation to have panthon as their official religion.

In the beginning Akobja focused very little on military and mostly focused on economic power.

However, two years after Hiperia was founded, Akobja realized how difficult it was to govern a nation with two separate parts to it that don’t share any borders so in 2004 he decided to split Hiperia into two parts which he called north and south Hiperia South Hiperia would have its own king who would rule until either his power was taken from him by Akobja, he died, or something else happened to him where he could not serve the role of king of South Hiperia.

Akobja appointed the first king of South Hiperia Ackja.

This king started off his rain very well passing two laws that Akobja really loved however Ackja past one law, making slavery, legal, and the king Akobja vetoed this law and told Ackja he wanted no slavery to be legal in Hiperia.

So Ackja agreed to this and promised to never try to pass a law on slavery again.

What did Ackja do after this, well, he tried passing another law promoting slavery again. This law went unnoticed for longer and actually got almost passed until a ambassador for North Hiperia who was at the time working in South Hiperia Told King Akobja about the new law, trying to make slavery legal.

As soon as King Akobja got the news he vetoed this law immediately, and was not planning on punishing king Ackja However Ackja was not happy about this whistleblower and hired someone to kidnap him when king Akobja found out about this he sentenced king Ackja to three years in federal prison in north Hiperia well, The former king Ackja decided to flee the nation, and he founded his own micro nation called the southern insurgencies, which promised to one day overthrow Hiperian rule.

However, after Ackja flood the country Akobja did not scrap the idea of having a separate government for south Hiperia so he appointed a second king to South Hiperia this second king was unimportant so I’m not going to talk about him however he did rule until 2014.

Speaking of 2014 this was a very chaotic year because in late 2013 everyone found out that king Akobja had disappeared.

The entire nation was in panic, but the government knew that the nation couldn’t just shut down because the leader had disappeared, so the government import appointed the leader that it had thought to be air to the throne.

The problem was two people claimed to be air to the throne because allegedly king Akobja told both of them that they could be king so this started a problem and the two people who had been told could be king had no one to fact check this with former king Akobja had disappeared starting the Hiperian Civil War in which king max(One of the potential airs) Founded the oligarchy of Hiperia and Arksma founded the monarchy of Hiperia.

The two sides declared war on each other, and the first one to render wood lose and go down in history as a failed potential leader of Hiperia.

King Max of the oligarchy refused to recognize the monarchy as a legitimate government and intern just referred to it as a rebel group.

We don’t know too much from the monarchy side of the Civil War however, we know some information from the oligarchy.

So King Max’s plan was to recruit as many micro nations in the area surrounding Hiperia and when they did not join willingly, he would forcefully annex them sometimes having to use military power.

Now the problem with the military from King Max’s oligarchy was that until that point Hiperia had not had a distinguished military.

This branch mostly consisted of high up military leaders and officials and their small units.

The most notable of micro nations that king Max and his oligarchy had to forcefully annex was Hermonia.

King Max met with the king of Hermonia in their capital King Max proposed to their king, the terms of rule where Hermonia would have to join the oligarchy temporarily and work to fight off any troops from the monarchy that invaded in the area and alert the oligarchy of any potential threat.

In return once the Civil War was over Hermonia would get full sovereignty, a potential ally, and Hiperia would have to pay them reparations.

The king of Hermonia did not agree to this, and told King Max that if he ever came back to the Hermonian peninsula then the two countries would go to war.

So King Max went home and the next day brought a local militia, consisting of 50 armed soldiers to the border between Hiperia and Hermonia.

The Hermonian king felt threatened by this and ordered his archers to stand guard.

King Max said to the other king, if you fire one arrow, then the oligarchy will burn down all of your cities.

So the other king reluctantly agreed to join the oligarchy and follow king maxes instruction.

So Hermonia Began militarizing in preparation for helping out in the Civil War the next year nothing happened and it would go on like this until winter 2015 when the monarchy invaded the oligarchical province of Hermon.

The way that they went about this invasion was the monarchy went to the far side of the lake from any civilization, and their plan was to make their way around the sides of the lake, conquering the two micro nations on the sides that includes the at the time sovereign Bulod and hermonia.

When the Hermonian hunting party found the 80 soldiers from the monarchy, they sent word to both the hermonian capital and the hermonian embassy in hermon.

When king Max found out about this, he instructed the Hermonians to go up and stand guard so that the monarchy man couldn’t push any further. That would give the oligarchy a chance to arrive with more advanced weaponry.

The oligarchy brought trebuchet’s, and catapults and arrows tipped with napalm gel.

And they worked to destroy the fort that the monarchy had set up.

The monarchy set up a fort called Ford van.

It took them two days to construct, and it took the oligarchy and the Hermonians 12 days to destroy due to the fact that the monarchy had 80 soldiers guarding the fort who were fighting back.

But eventually the oligarchy and the Hermonians destroyed the fort this battle was called the siege of Ford van.

When the fort fell king, Max instructed the monarchies soldiers to go back and tell the king of the monarchy about how powerful the oligarchy military is, and instruct him to step down.

{{< details title="Kingdom of Pibocip (Click to Expand)" >}}

The Kingdom of Pibocip History: 

Independence: July 12th 2000  
Founder: H.H. Phillip J. Pillin  
Queen Anita Massaro First Monarch: 2000 - 2005  
King Philip Joseph Pillin: 2005 - Present  

Pibocip was conceived as a form of childhood play inspired by the “Chronicles of Narnia” and the “Princess Diaries,” and later scenes from “The Bridge to Terabithia.” We associate the foundation of Pibocip on 12th July 2000, although the date is a “legendary” foundation day. Indeed, however, the Pibocian Concept is from the very early 21st century. The Pibocian Concept continued for several years, under the reign of Queen Anita, as a childhood fantasy and form of play. Once Prince Phillip J. Started to grow older, the Pibocian Concept became more of a thought experiment, something which it continues to be today. This thought experiment is one that explores the ideas of what constitutes a state as understood by the declarative theory of the Montevideo Convention. This thought experiment was embodied in the Phi Sigma Tau’s Dialogue Journal article “Declarations of Micronations: A Case for Legitimizing Micronations” by H.H. Phillip J. published in October 2020. In 2017-2018, Pibocip experienced a renaissance in excitement and interest. This renaissance saw an expansion of physical territory and other developments of ideas and culture. Notably, these developments included the adoption of Catholic Social Teaching, Subsidiarity, and John Locke’s Classical Liberalism. During this time in the summer of 2018, Prince Phillip J. as foreign minister, discovered the growing idea of Micronationalism and other micronations spread throughout the world. Since then, Pibocip has become an even more advanced, cultured, and sound micronation. Pibocip has had the honor of sending delegates to Microcon 2019 and has since signed treaties and entered into diplomatic relations with several other countries. In 2021, Pibocip joined the Cupertino Alliance and the GUM. Pibocians are proud of their strong and experienced past and look forward to a bright future. Pibocip hopes to continue to expand in the future to continue to be “A Light to the Nations” serving for the common good of all people.

{{< details title="State of Rovia (Click to Expand)" >}}

Rovia Secessionist Movement  
The Rovia Movement was the catalyst for Rovia's founding; it was the movement that led to the nation's birth. President Motaz, the movement's originator, had begun to take on several roles in certain Micronational governments during this time, and those same nations were to become allies with Rovia after it was created. The Rovani language was developed for the first time after its original founding by locals in the area hundreds of years ago during the Rovia Rebellion. The movement came to an end when the lands of Rovia declared independence and when the delayed but inevitable formation of the Rovian government, as the movement's purpose had been achieved.

Kingdom of Rovia  
The Rovia Secessionist Movement came to an end on 5 April 2021, when the president of the movement, Motaz, declared himself King of the established Kingdom of Rovia.

The Gartius League  
The Kingdom of Rovia joined the multiple micronations that King Motaz I had previously served and established ties with most. Then, on 7 April, Rovia founded the Gartius League with 14 other micronations although the number would fluctuate as some officially joined while others remained observers. One of them, the UCCS, officially the United Communist Community of Singaporlando, would wage war with Rovia and the other league members after their delegate repeatedly promoted suicide.

The First and Second War of the Ousting  
The UCCS would go on to support their delegate and declare war on Rovia and other member states of the league. However, some of the member states of the league managed to convince UCCS government officials to stop their operations and for peace to remain. However, this did not last long as a few weeks later, after the again continued promotion of suicide by the delegate of the UCCS, all members of the Gartius League, including Rovia, voted unanimously to kick the UCCS from the league. Again, another war was waged by the UCCS. This war never came to an end, but there have been rumors going on that the UCCS has been dismantled after it had been banned from using Microwiki, if that is true then the war had come to an end.

Creation of the Empire  
After Rovia incorporated two colonies near what is now the sovereign state of Karaz , the Empire was founded unofficially. After a brief period as a colony, Viyeldty was raised to statehood status. Emperor Motaz I found the Greater Rovian Empire officially on 3 June 2021.

Emperor Motaz I commented on this later, stating that ''The Kingdom was the beginning, the Empire was the turning point in the gleaming history of our nation.''

Continued rise and expansion  
A mini golden age began and lasted from 3 June until 22 July. Rovia enjoyed tremendous political success with its government, a revamping of its arts and technology, and diplomatic success among numerous micronations during this brief era. The Rovian government received a major boost when Prime Minister Esty Carpentieri chose his cabinet, which would govern the country for a year, marking the start of the expansion of political foundations in the country for the first time since the independence of the country. Jamasatnia, a vassal state of Rovia, likewise pledged its loyalty to Rovia.

Steady Decline  
Jamasatnia declared independence from Rovia on 22 July. It experienced minimal change during the Empire's brief reign of control of the country and was somewhat cut off from the Empire. However, one triumph could be credited, which was the expansion of Jamasatnia's political foundations.

Tobey Wyles, who was chosen by Rovia, was appointed as Prime Minister of Jamasatnia. Rovia tried to keep Jamasatnia under control, but in the end Emperor Motaz I declared Jamasatnia independent. The mini golden age came to an end with the end of Rovian expansion, as well as other political, technological, and cultural accomplishments.

The War of the Misapprehended  
As Rovia continued to steadily decline, a nation-state by the name of Yeshilova tried to establish diplomatic ties with Rovia. Somewhere along the way, two delegates from different countries mistook each other's words for rude remarks. This caused outrage from both sides, and Yeshilova then declared war on Rovia. Emperor Motaz I quickly rallied the nation's online presence, as any cyber attack would have made Rovia's presence with the online world disappear. After a brief online meeting with Yeshilova's leader, both leaders agreed that their countries would no longer be in war and that both countries would establish diplomatic relations, and both agreed that what happened was a misunderstanding, hence the naming of the war: The War of the Misapprehended. After that both countries became allies.

Dissolution  
On the 15 October, Emperor Mo I met with the Rovani Government to discuss dissolving Rovia because of the number of wars that had exhausted the empire. The empire was dissolved as a consequence, and the empire's land was transferred in the following order: Vyeldty to Pinang, Parraesty to Kanazia, although Kanzia has not administered it and doesn't consider it part of their land. The land has since been returned to Saudi Arabia. And the remainder has also been returned to Egypt and Saudi Arabia.

On the same day, the Empire's demise was announced, and dissolution talks came to a conclusion. For half a year, the empire had dissolved, and all lands were receded back to the Egyptian, Saudi Arabian, and Italian governments.

This marked the start of Rovia's tumultuous period. And, despite the fact that the dissolving of the country was peaceful and that only the emperor himself proposed it (which was necessary since the nation could not have survived numerous times of crises and three wars), the prevalent sentiment regarding the empire's partition is one of sadness.

Second Rovian Empire  
The Second Rovian Empire was established on 26 March 2022, by the Emperor and the royal family, with former government officials and former allies notified. On 22 November 2022, Rovia reformed the Gartius League and on 23 March 2023, Rovia joined the Grand Unified Micronational as an observer state. The second Prime Minister election took place on the 8th of August, 2023, with Prime Minister Sam. A retaining his position and a cabinet of 6 ministers (including the prime minister) chosen.

State of Rovia  
On 8 January 2024, the Constitution of Rovia was made, declaring it to be a state and with the Sultan as the ruler. New elections are set to take place in the following months and will be affected by the newly ratified constitution.
