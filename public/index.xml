      <description>Welcome to the Cupertino Forum! A diplomatic forum for micronational cooperation, diplomacy, and socializing. Here is the document that describes how the forum works in detail.&#xA;The Cupertino Forum is the successor organization to the Cupertino alliance. While it still bares some resemblance, it is very different in form and function. In the final days of the Cupertino Alliance, members claimed that the primary value that the CA provided for its members in its current state was as a social venue where members can discuss micronationalism, share news, see what others are doing, collaborate, and otherwise make friends.</description>
